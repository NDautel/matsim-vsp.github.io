<p><b>03 May 2021</b> - The TU Berlin exchange email server has been attacked and in consequence is currently down. It is unknown how long this outage will last.</p>

<p>If you have been trying to contact us, we apologize. Please read below for help on how to reach us.</p>

### Reaching us via email

We have set up temporary email addresses outside the TU system. To reach staff directly, use the formula

`firstname.lastname.vsp @ posteo.net`

So for example:

- Kai Nagel can be emailed at `kai.nagel.vsp [at] posteo.net`
- All full-time staff can be reached in the same manner.
