### Current information and contact options

Due to the current limitations of the server infrastructure of the TU Berlin, we are not reachable via the usual mail addresses of the TU Berlin. Therefore we have published new contact options on the homepage here at <https://vsp.berlin>.

You can find out about the current status of the restrictions at the TU Berlin here: [ZECM TU Berlin](https://www.campusmanagement.tu-berlin.de/zecm/)
