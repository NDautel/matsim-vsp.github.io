title: "IT Update: Email service restored!"

### Email service to all VSP/TU Berlin staff and employees is restored.

TU Berlin will continue to work on recovery of attacked IT infrastructure through June and July 2021. They have now restored email access, so all staff should be reachable at their regular `tu-berlin.de` addresses.

Some other IT infrastructure remains out of service, so please bear with us as we work through the summer to restore everything.
