title: Email and IT Update

### Current information and contact options

TU Berlin will continue to work on recovery of attacked IT infrastructure through June and July 2021. They have restored email access, so all staff should be reachable at their regular `tu-berlin.de` addresses.

Some other IT infrastructure remains out of service, so please bear with us as we work through the summer to restore everything.
